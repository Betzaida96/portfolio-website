# portfolio-website

This is my very first portfolio website. I wanted a website where I could easily view the work I have created in my journey to learning coding. While I don't have any published work yet, I have used some placeholder images for now. In the process of creating this website, I learned some basic HTML and CSS Skills. I had many challenges, and still don't feel as if it's where I want it to be. But as I learn more, I can come back and update it with the things I have learned.

Currenty there are links in the navigation bar that take you to the section of the webpage that you would like to view. And there are placeholder images you can click on that will take you to a fun place. Here is a little snippet of what the website looks like.
